This is an ActiveRecord plugin make you easily store emoji to DB.

Supporting:

- Encode emoji to UTF8 text before save. `üê∂`->`:dog:`
- Decode encoded emoji in the instance of model. `:dog:`->`üê∂`

## Concept

In order to store the emoji to your Database, we need following steps.
 
- Change the charset from `utf8` to `utf8mb4`.
- Upgrade MySQL version greater than `5.5`.

But "Rumojinize" make it simple!!

## Usage

**Install gem:**

```
gem 'rumojinize'
```

```
bundle install
```

**Set up by `rumojinize`.**

```
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  rumojinize :body
end
```

Also you can rumojinize multiple fields.

```
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  rumojinize :body, :title
end
```

## Example

**For example, Rumojinize will encode `üê∂` to `:dog:` before save to DB, and decode in the instance.**
